# ðŸ§º Index Fund Market

As the cryptocurrency market matures, investors are seeking diversified and professionally managed options that capture the broader market trends. An Index Fund structured product addresses this demand by offering exposure to a basket of top-performing cryptocurrencies, providing a balanced and risk-mitigated approach.

The products could target the whole cryptocurrency market, or a market segment/ theme, via a pre-defined methodology. A sub category would be index products like Index Coopâ€™s DeFi Pulse Index, capturing assets from DeFi space.

There are fewer products in this category that have attracted over >$1m TVL, let alone >$10m TVL, and a higher percentage of these index products are built on Ethereum.

The market opportunity lies in the convenience, transparency, and simplicity that an Index Fund structured product brings, making it an attractive option for both seasoned and novice investors looking to participate in the cryptocurrency market with a strategic and well-managed approach.
