# Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum, known for its smart contract functionality, has also demonstrated substantial growth since its launch in 2015. Ethereum has shown a higher percentage gain compared to Bitcoin over some periods, driven by its role as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and various blockchain projects. However, Ethereum's price is more susceptible to market trends and developments in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. From its inception in 2015, Ethereum has seen an approximate annual mean return of around 194.4% and has often outpaced traditional investments. However, keep in mind that these returns can vary significantly depending on the specific time frames considered.
