## Blockchain

As we take decenttralisation very seriously, ultimately we plan to expand our reach to the most popular blockchains, but we're stratigically choosing BNB Blockchain to kickstart Blue Chip.

- Binance is the largest Exchange, aggregating the wide spectrum of crypto enthusiasts.
- Binance offers EVM chain Tooling for deploying smart-contracts
  = Low gas fee enable the core ideas of deploying digital products on chain.

## Smart-Contracts

- Openzeppelin: Contract library, offering out of the box solution for tokenisation, governance, and other audited utilities.
- Set Protocol: Exploring setprotocol for developing Blue Chip Index fund, similiar to the lines of DPI from Index Coop

<!-- Mention Other smart-contract library to be used -->

## Oracles

BNB offers a range of Oracles, but we'll consider in foloowing order:

- [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/)
- [Binance Oracle](https://oracle.binance.com/docs/)

List of oracles on BNB Chain are present [here](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/oracles)

## Exchanges

- Pancake Swap: Largessst Exchange on Binance (Must include)
- Stargate: Omnichain DeFi
- Biswap: DEX with low trading fee
- Uniswap: Largest EVM based dex

Calculating Components/ assets

- List Top 10 Cryptocurrency by Market Cap
- Use the list to create array of Coponents Address in decresing value in Market Cap
- Trigger UpdateComponents if the list is changed

Calculating Component Units

- For every asset, ideal % of asset in Index score (% score) is calculated to represent market share (Market cap of asset / Sum of market cap of all assets included)
- for every asset, Ideal Value is calculated using % score x Total Portfolio value
- Asset in exact is calculatd by Ideal Asset Value / Price of Asset
- Units are calculated by Asset in exact / total supply

- Simply explained, Units = % score x Total Portfolio value / price of asset x total supply === % score x token price / price of asset

Rebalancing Portfolio
Once Index Composition in Units are set, the portfolio is rebalanced hourly to bring asset value to idea index composition by trading assets automatically.

- For every asset, % value in portfolio is calculate by value of asset/ Value of Portfolio
- Compare with original % score
- Buy assets, which have % value in portfolio < ideal % of asset in Index
- Sell assets, which have % value in portfolio > ideal % of asset in Index
