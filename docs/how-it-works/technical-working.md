# Technical Mechanics

## Blockchain

As we take decenttralisation very seriously, ultimately we plan to expand our reach to the most popular blockchains, but we're stratigically choosing BNB Blockchain to kickstart Blue Chip.

- Binance is the largest Exchange, aggregating the wide spectrum of crypto enthusiasts.
- Binance offers EVM chain Tooling for deploying smart-contracts
  = Low gas fee enable the core ideas of deploying digital products on chain.

## Smart-Contracts

- Openzeppelin: Contract library, offering out of the box solution for tokenisation, governance, and other audited utilities.
- Set Protocol: Exploring setprotocol for developing Blue Chip Index fund, similiar to the lines of DPI from Index Coop

<!-- Mention Other smart-contract library to be used -->

BNB offers a range of Oracles, but we'll consider in foloowing order:

- [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/)
- [Binance Oracle](https://oracle.binance.com/docs/)
